    <p>Hello my name is Howard Mullins, I am a freshman at Brophy College Preparatory. I was born on October 13, 2009. I am an Asian American. My hobbies include playing video games, playing basketball, and listening to music. My middle school was Magnet Traditional and I played basketball for them. I am also a big Phoenix Suns fan(sadly).I usually play free games like Marvel Rivals and games like that, I also play "horror" games with my friends, usually R.E.P.O and I play Minecraft. My favorite color is black, my favorite food is noodles, and my favorite drink is Baja Blast. I also like to listen to music and my favorite artist is Boywithuke.</p>
    <p>I also am in the Robotics Club for Brophy and our VEX team won a competition, my team was also the first to win a VEX competition among the 4 other VEX teams in the school.</p>
