    <p>Hello my name is Howard Mullins, I am a freshman at Brophy College Preparatory. I was born on October 13, 2009. I am part Asian, German, and American. My hobbies include playing video games, playing basketball, and listening to music. My middle school was Magnet Traditional and I played basketball for them.
