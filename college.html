<p>I am interested in MIT because it is a great school for engineering and I hope to be an engineer one day. (middle picture)</p>
<p>I also am interested in Purdue University because my neighbors told me that being a pilot can be a good job and Purdue offers flight training programs. (picture on the right)</p>
<p>I am also interested in Arizona State University because it is a good school with a high acceptance rate, and it is in state. (picture on the left)</p>
